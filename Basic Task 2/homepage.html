      <h2>About Coffee</h2>
      <p>
      Coffee is one of the world’s most popular beverages, originating in Ethiopia and evolving into a global cultural icon. Made from seeds of the Coffea plant, it undergoes a complex process of cultivation, roasting, and brewing to achieve its rich flavors. Coffee drives economies in major producing countries like Brazil and Colombia and serves as a social and cultural connector worldwide. From espresso to pour-over, it’s both an art and a science, uniting people through a shared appreciation for its unique taste and energizing effects. More than just a drink, coffee is a lifestyle and global tradition.      </p>

      <h2>History of Coffee</h2>
      <p>
        Coffee’s history dates back to 9th-century Ethiopia, where it was first discovered by a goat herder who noticed his goats becoming energetic after eating coffee cherries. It later spread to Yemen, where it became a vital part of Sufi rituals. By the 15th century, coffee houses, or "qahveh khaneh," flourished in the Middle East, becoming centers for socializing and intellectual discussions. The drink reached Europe in the 17th century, sparking the rise of coffee houses known as "penny universities," where ideas and news were exchanged. Over time, coffee became a global commodity, driving the economies of countries like Brazil and Indonesia. Its journey from a small Ethiopian village to the modern-day coffee culture highlights its enduring role in history as a unifying and stimulating force.
